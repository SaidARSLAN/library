# Library Management

This is a personal project focused on leveraging the latest technologies in web development. My goal is to push my current skills to the limit and continuously improve my programming expertise.

## Technologies Used

| Technology  | Why I Used It? |  
|-------------|---------------|  
| **Next.js**  | Routing, SSR, SEO optimization, loading management, authentication |  
| **TypeScript**  | Type safety and cleaner code |  
| **Zod**  | Form validation and type enforcement |  
| **ShadCN**  | Experimenting with the latest UI components using Tailwind CSS |  
| ...  | |  

This project is still a work in progress.
